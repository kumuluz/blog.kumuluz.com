GraphQL is becoming more relevant every day. Its usage is rapidly spreading across the internet. KumuluzEE was among the first frameworks to offer a standalone GraphQL extension, which offers a simple way to integrate GraphQL to new/existing microservices. Our efforts have been recognized across the community with the post of an article about the GraphQL extension published at [https://jefrajames.wordpress.com/2019/03/08/graphql-with-kumuluzee/](https://jefrajames.wordpress.com/2019/03/08/graphql-with-kumuluzee/). If you still have not familiarized yourself with the topic, this article is a good place to start!
