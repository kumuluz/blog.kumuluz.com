We are releasing KumuluzEE version 3.3.0.

This release adds a new feature that enables you to intercept and apply transformation to a value that is being read
from the configuration. The feature is called Configuration Decoder and to use it simply implement the
`ConfigurationDecoder` interface and register it using a service file. For example:

<!--more-->

```java
public class CustomConfigurationDecoder implements ConfigurationDecoder {

    @Override
    public boolean shouldDecode(String key) {
        return "rest-config.encoded-property".equals(key);
    }

    @Override
    public String decode(String key, String value) {
        return new String(DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(value));
    }
}
```

Remember to register the implementation in a service file named `com.kumuluz.ee.configuration.ConfigurationDecoder`.

Dependency versions have also been updated in this release. The main change is an upgrade of the _jackson_ dependency
to 2.9.8. We also changed the way _jackson_ dependency is imported so the version is synchronized across all KumuluzEE
dependencies.

#### Features:

- Added `ConfigurationDecoder`.

#### Enhancements:

- Updated dependency versions.
