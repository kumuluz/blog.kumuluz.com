We're announcing the release of the KumuluzEE JWT Auth 1.0.1. This release adds the MP-JWKS support for KumuluzEE JWT Auth. 
This allows the library to use JWKS as a source of verification keys.

More details about this release can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-jwt-auth/releases/tag/v1.0.1).

*Please note that this release is not yet compliant with the MicroProfile JWT Auth 1.1 specification. A new version will be 
available in the near future.*
