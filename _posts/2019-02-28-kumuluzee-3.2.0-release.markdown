We are announcing the availability of KumuluzEE version 3.2.0.

This release brings compliancy with the MicroProfile 1.3, 1.4, 2.0 and 2.1. MicroProfile is an open initiative extending
Enterprise Java with standardized APIs in order to optimize Java EE for a microservice architecture. These APIs allow
you to collect and expose application metrics in a standardized way, trace requests across multiple microservices, invoke
RESTful APIs in a type-safe and intuitive way, introduce common fault-tolerance patterns, document microservices using
the OpenAPI and much more.

To start using MicroProfile with KumuluzEE pick the version that suits your needs and use one of the following
dependencies:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee</groupId>
