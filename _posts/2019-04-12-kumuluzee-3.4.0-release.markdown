We are happy to announce the release of KumuluzEE version 3.4.0.

This release brings a new utility class `JsonConfigurationUtil`, a companion to the familiar `ConfigurationUtil`. It
enables retrieval of a part of the configuration hierarcy as a JSON-P object. For more information and a few examples
check out the [PR](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee/pull/143). To start using this feature simply add the JSON-P
dependency (`kumuluzee-json-p-jsonp`) and start using the utility class.

We have also added a toggle that adds test classes to the classpath. This is useful when running tests manually
(without Arquillian). To enable this feature set the `kumuluzee.dev.running-tests` configuration property to `true` when
running tests.

This release also brings some much needed fixes for the JPA-JTA integration. JTA is now behaving properly when using XA
datasources. We have also added the missing `getMapKeys` method for the environment variables configuration source.

#### Features:

- Added `JsonConfigurationUtil`.
- Added toggle that adds test classes to the classpath.

#### Enhancements:

- Added `getMapKeys` in environment variables configuration source.

#### Bugs:

- Fixed JPA-JTA integration.
