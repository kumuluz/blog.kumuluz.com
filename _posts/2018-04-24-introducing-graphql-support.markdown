We have released the first snapshot of **KumuluzEE GraphQL** extension. 

GraphQL is a data query language developed internally at Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server. It is a strongly typed runtime which allows clients to dictate what data is needed. This avoids both the problems of over-fetching as well as under-fetching of data.

KumuluzEE GraphQL enables you to easily create your GraphQL endpoint or convert an exsisting REST endpoint with the use of annotations.
Learn more about [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) or get started with a [basic sample](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples/tree/master/kumuluzee-graphql-jpa-simple).
