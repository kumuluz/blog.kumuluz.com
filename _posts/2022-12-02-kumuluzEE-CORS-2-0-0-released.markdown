We are excited to announce the next major version of KumuluzEE CORS - 2.0.0. This release adds support for the newest KumuluzEE version 4 and adds support for Java 17 LTS and Java 18.
Since the support for Java 1.8 is dropped by KumuluzEE 4.x, the KumuluzEE CORS 2.0.0 also drops support for Java 1.8.

Features
- Added support for KumuluzEE 4.0.0 and above
- Added support for Java 17 LTS and Java 18

__Note: This release of KumuluzEE Config MP requires the KumuluzEE 4.0 or higher in order to work correctly.
Consequently, Java 11 or higher is also required.__
